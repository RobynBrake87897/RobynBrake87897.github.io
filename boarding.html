        <h1>Boarding at the ARC</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Our boarding facility is designed to offer an affordable, clean, well maintained temporary living space for our client's animals while their owners are away on vacation, moving or renovating their home. <br />
            We usually offer space for their animals from one night through to a 21 day stay at one time. Longer boarding can be arranged if confirmed in advance. <br />
            Due to our staff consisting of a full time animal health technician, a visiting veterinarian and other qualified personnel, we are also able to administer medication, special diets and any other special requirements at no extra charge. Staff are on site from early in the morning to well into the night. <br />
            Dogs are taken outside no less than 5 times per day to play and use the bathroom, with kennels cleaned completely every day. Proper play time will be established inside and outside if needed. We make a conscious effort to monitor all behaviours of our guests and try to make them feel at home as best we can, if you are bringing more than one dog for a vacation with us please advise as to how many kennels are needed. <br />
            Dogs may be bathed if we feel it is necessary due to bad weather. Nail trims may also be provided if requested. If customers request additional services, a small fee may be applied (following discussion with owner). <br />
            All cats will remain in the cat room while in our care, with up to 4 cats recommended per room. No boarding animals are allowed to roam freely through the shelter. <br />
            In the case of an emergency, all animals will be provided with appropriate veterinary care at the owners expense by our veterinary team. A waiver and authorization must be signed and completed at the time of boarding, along with providing emergency contact information for us to provide updates as and when needed. <br />
            All fees are to be paid in advance unless other, authorized, arrangements have been made.
